The project uses an e-commerce dataset (`your_dataset.csv`) with the following parameters:

* `product_name`: Name of the product.
* `category`: Category of the product.
* `discounted_price`: Discounted price of the product.
* `actual_price`: Actual price of the product.
* `discount_percentage`: Percentage of discount.
* `rating`: Rating of the product.
* `rating_count`: Number of ratings.
* `about_product`: Product description.
* `user_id`: ID of the user who wrote the review.
* `user_name`: Name of the user who wrote the review.
* `review_id`: ID of the review.
* `review_title`: Title of the review.
* `review_content`: Content of the review.
* `img_link`: Image link of the product.
* `product_link`: Product link.

## Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd ecom_analysis
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up MySQL:**
    * Install MySQL if you haven't already.
    * Create a database named `ecom_analysis`.
    * Import the data into MySQL using the script (`scripts/load_data_to_mysql.py`).
    * Update the MySQL connection details in the script.

5.  **Run Jupyter Notebooks:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    * Open the notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory and follow the instructions.

## Key Analyses

* **Product Performance Analysis:** Identifies best-selling products and categories, analyzes the impact of discounts, and explores product ratings.
* **Customer Analysis (If Applicable):** Segments customers using RFM analysis, analyzes purchase patterns, and identifies churn risk.
* **Review Analysis:** Performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews and identifies common topics and keywords.
* **Pricing Analysis:** Analyzes the relationship between prices, discounts, and sales, and explores pricing strategies.

## Further Insights and Interpretation

This project goes beyond basic data exploration and aims to provide actionable business insights by:

* Identifying profitable product categories and seasonal trends.
* Segmenting customers into personas and suggesting targeted marketing strategies.
* Analyzing customer sentiment and extracting key topics from reviews.
* Simulating pricing strategies and estimating price elasticity.
